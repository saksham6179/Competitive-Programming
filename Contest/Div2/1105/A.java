/* Problem Statement
A. Another Popcount Problem
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given two integers n
 and k
.

Your task is to construct a sequence a
 consisting of k
 non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ak
 such that:

∑ki=1ai≤n
The total number of set bits, i.e., ∑ki=1popcount(ai)
, is as large as possible.
You only need to output the maximum possible value of ∑ki=1popcount(ai)
.

Here, popcount(x)
 denotes the number of 1
 bits in the binary representation of x
. For example, popcount(6)=popcount((110)2)=2
, and popcount(0)=0
.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤103
). The description of the test cases follows.

Each of the next t
 lines contains two integers n
 and k
 (1≤n,k≤106
) — the maximum allowed sum of the sequence and the length of the sequence, respectively.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible value of ∑ki=1popcount(ai)
.

Note
In the first test case, n=2
 and k=1
. We can choose a=[1]
 or a=[2]
. In both cases, the sum of popcounts is 1
.

In the second test case, n=3
 and k=1
. We can choose a=[3]
, since (3)2=(11)2
, popcount(3)=2
.

In the third test case, n=6
 and k=2
. We can choose a=[3,3]
. The sum is 3+3=6≤6
, and the total popcount is popcount(3)+popcount(3)=2+2=4
.
