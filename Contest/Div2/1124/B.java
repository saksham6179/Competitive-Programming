Problem Statement

B. KiaKio and Squared Numbers
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Kia and Kio spent the summer at the port of Mehragan, where n
 lighthouses stand on the cliffs facing the dark sea.

The lighthouses of Mehragan do not give light. Every night a number is written in fire on each of them, and the sailors read their way from those numbers.

The law of the lighthouses is this: if a lighthouse shows x
 tonight, then tomorrow night it shows the sum of the squares of the decimal digits of x
.

For example, a lighthouse showing 23
 will show 22+32=13
 tomorrow, then 12+32=10
, and then 1
.

On night 0
 of the season, lighthouse i
 shows the number ai
. From that night on, the law is applied once every night, forever.

Kio calls two lighthouses i
 and j
 in tune if there exists a night after which, forever, both of them show exactly the same number on every single night.

Kia asks: how many pairs (i,j)
 with i<j
 are in tune?

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤1000
). The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤1000
) — the number of lighthouses.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤109
) — the number shown by each lighthouse on night 0
.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 1000
.

Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the number of pairs (i,j)
 with i<j
 such that lighthouses i
 and j
 are in tune.

Note
In the first test case:

Lighthouse 1
 starts at 7
: 7→49→97→130→10→1
, and it stays at 1
 forever.
Lighthouses 2
 and 4
 both start at 4
, so they show the same number on every night.
Lighthouse 3
 starts at 16
 and lighthouse 5
 starts at 2
; each of them is at a different point of the cycle Kio found, and never matches anybody.
So the only pair in tune is (2,4)
, and the answer is 1
.

In the second test case, every lighthouse sooner or later reaches 1
 and stays there, so all of them are pairwise in tune, which gives 6
 pairs.

In the fourth test case, on night 1
, lighthouse 2
 shows 22+02=4
, and lighthouse 1
 shows 22=4
. From night 1
 on, they are identical forever. Lighthouse 3
 starts at 4
, so it is one night ahead of both of them and is in tune with neither.
